# metronome
This open source metronome is designed by Ethan Cayko, and supported by CERNET Project 2. 
The primary function of this software is to calibrate the latency between each node (or location) in a network music performance to a desired rhythmic unit of time at a chosen tempo. To do this, the software measures the latency in the network and applies additional delay to each nodeâ€™s audio signal by the appropriate times (in milliseconds).
